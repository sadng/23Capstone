	<h1>Hazards in Hawai'i</h1>
    <h2>Capstone</h2>

	<p3>As the world erupts, floods, and finds ways to change under our feet, hazardous events pose a threat to human life and properties, creating vulnerability in affected communities.
		Unfortunately, some communities do not have the proper hazard education resources that allows users to gain hazard awareness.
		When an event occurs, these communities are left unprepared and overwhelmed with feelings of panic, fear, and worry, hoping to find a sense of safety when a hazardous event occurs.
		Understanding the surrounding hazards allows individuals to be prepared for these events, making them feel safer as they can acknowledge what the event means, how to respond based on personal risk, and how to recover.
		By using GIS applications, preexisting hazard awareness resources, hazard assessment datasets, and historical hazardous event records provided by the Hawaii GIS Program and the United States Geological Survey, the project created will be a web application that community members of the Hawaiian Islands to insert a location onto a map and learn about their local hazards.
		The hazard assessments included will showcase their locationsâ€™ projected susceptibility to flooding, tsunamis, fires, and volcanic lava flows in the future.
		As a result of using this platform, the community will increase their knowledge to create hazard awareness and be useful to future urban developments.
		Helping the communities further prepare for their local hazardous events moving forward, allowing for greater resilience through hazard impact recovery.</p3>
